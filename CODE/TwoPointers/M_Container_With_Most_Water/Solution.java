// 1. Given an array of heights, each height represents a vertical bar on the x-axis.
// 2. You choose any two bars.
// 3. These two bars and the x-axis form a container.
// 4. Calculate the maximum area (amount of water) that can be stored between any two bars.
// 5. The area is determined by the shorter bar's height Ã— the distance between the bars.
